# Netflix_Project

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Netflix’s content catalog using Python and popular data analysis libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Overview

The dataset includes information about Netflix shows and movies, such as:
- Title
- Type (Movie or TV Show)
- Country of origin
- Release year
- Rating
- Duration
- Genre/category

The goal of this project is to explore the dataset and answer key questions through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Key Steps

- Loaded and explored the dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`)
- Cleaned data by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns
- Converted date fields to proper datetime format
- Split multi-genre entries into individual rows
- Created various visualizations to explore:
  - Most popular genres
  - Content release trends over the years
  - Country-wise content distribution
  - Rating distribution
  - Duration trends of movies and TV shows
  - Genre and rating evolution over time

## Visual Insights

- Bar charts and histograms to show distribution across genres, countries, and ratings
- Line plots to track trends over time (e.g., content releases, genre popularity)
- Histograms to show movie and TV show duration trends

## Tools

- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is [Netflix Titles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) from Kaggle.

## Conclusion

This project highlights Netflix’s global content strategy, genre trends, and how user preferences and content offerings have changed over the years. It serves as a foundational data analysis project demonstrating EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) skills using Python.
